For the better part of my life I've attended school. Here's what that looks like.

 * K-5:  [King Elementary School](http://old.akronschools.com/schools/home/index.dot?schId=10738)
 * 6-8:  [Litchfield Middle School](http://old.akronschools.com/schools/home/index.dot?schId=10732)
 * 9-12: [Firestone High School](http://old.akronschools.com/schools/home/index.dot?schId=10297)
   - Notable for it's "[Project Lead the way](http://www.pltwohio.org/about_overview.php)" engineering program.
   - I spent a lot of time in that engineering room...
 * [University of Akron](https://www.uakron.edu/) - Computer Science

I don't currently have any plans for Graduate school.
