## General Education Courses [Completed 42/42 (-2) (Total 40)]

All General Education classes are completed as of Fall of 2012. I received +1 extra credit for my English requirement,
however, the 3 credits for mathematics count towards the CS core curriculum. So we must make a -2 adjustment to the
credits to even things out. An extra two credits will be required to graduate (the adjustment can be seen in the `Other
Courses` category.

## Computer Science Courses [Completed 75/75]

This follows the

## Other Courses? [0/11 (+2) Total (13)]

All required computer science courses are completed. However because of the 128
credit requirement by University I still have 13 credits to accumulate before I
may graduate.

 * 3 | iOS development **[Upcoming Fall 2013]**

Other possible courses:

 * 3 | Introduction to Bioinformatics **[Upcoming Fall 2013]**
 * 3 | Artificial Intelligence & Heuristics Programming **[Upcoming Fall 2013]**
