## Evan Purkhisers Resume

This section of the repository contains my resume written in
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

I'm not a big fan of filling my resume with over-hyped trendy technology
buzzwords. The skills listed on my resume are the skills I believe I have enough
experience with to be able to jump into any project and get going right away.
Sure I have done my fair share of tinkering with things like C++, Java, Python,
Lua, or whatever, but I wouldn't consider these something that I could say I'm
highly experienced with. Of course, that's not to say I'm not a fast learner. I
would love to pickup a new technology and build something cool learn about how
it works!

Also please don't ask for my resume in Microsoft Word format!
