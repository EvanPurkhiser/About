## Experience

### Crunchyroll / Ellation
*August 2014 - Present*  
Software Engineer

 - Spearheaded divorce of a deeply integrated client front end and monolith
   backend into a cleanly separated API consuming client using a modern PHP
   Symfony stack.
 - Architected and developed secure authentication mechanisms for a novel dual
   subscription linking system using the OAuth 1.0 protocol for the account API
   driving the VRV product.
 - Designed and developed high performance APIs with golang to serve video
   content catalog metadata, including image serving. Applied the HATEOAS REST
   constraint to provide flexibility during rapid API design changes.
 - Full stack implementation of a 'content partner' portal for content
   management. Developed using react & redux along with modern web
   technologies. Special attention of quality was given to the 'look and feel'.
 - Proliferated quality coding standards, git best practices, review best
   practices, automated style linting tooling, and improved developer
   environment tooling through the organization for a high quality developer
   experience.

Working at Ellation I found myself surrounded by the brightest engineers I have
ever worked with. I was able to personally grow and sharpen my skills through
mentorship in both directions. While simultaneously working as a single team to
ship a world class product. Launching *VRV* was a milestone in my career.
